* `coffee` always returns generated files [n8han](http://github.com/n8han)

* new wave sbt versioning. sbt version will now be appended to the library version

    version <<= sbtVersion("0.1.2-%s" format _)

* uses a proper config, Coffee.

All keys are defined under the `coffee` namespace. The primary `coffee` task is available in the global scope.

* `coffee:coffee-target` now defaults to path `target/scala-2.8.1.final/resource_managed/main/js`

To go back the previous mapping use

    seq(coffeescript.CoffeeScript.coffeeSettings: _*)
    targetDirectory in Coffee <<= (resourceManaged in Compile) { _ / "www" / "js" }

* use simpler key names based on sbt conventions

    coffee-clean  -> coffee:clean
    coffee-source -> coffee:source-directory
    coffee-target -> coffee:target-directory
    coffee        -> coffee or coffee:coffee

* introduce a `coffee:sources` key that returns all CoffeeScript sources

* no more auto include setting magic, explicitly injected coffee keys. In your `build.sbt` file add the following line

    seq(coffeescript.CoffeeScript.coffeeSettings : _*)

* small refactorings
